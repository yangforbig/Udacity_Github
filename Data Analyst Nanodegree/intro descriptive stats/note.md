# intro to descriptive statistics

1. validity:
(1) who you investigate 
(2) how many you investigate
(3) what method you used 

2. construct:
object that hasn't been measured --- operational definition 

3. sampling error Âµ-x(bar)

4. point estimate might not good enough to predict the population characteristics that is why we use interval.

5. random sample means each subject has equal chance to be selected 

6. when we visualize data, it is easier to draw conclusion.

7. correlation does not imply causation

8. Golden Arches Theory: no two counties with a McDonald have ever gone into a war since opening the store.


9. Show correlation: observational studies 

   Show causation: control experiments 


11. Blind and Double blind:

neither the researcher nor the participant know which experiment they receive


the influence of uncontrolled variables can be diminished by random sampling: make group similar 

Lurking variable: 
A lurking variable is a variable that is not included as an explanatory or 
response variable in the analysis but can affect the interpretation of relationships between variables


positive skewed(left tail longer), negative skewed(right tail longer)

uniform distribution has no mode.

positive skewed distribution: mode < median < mean


traditionally, statistician cut off lower and upper 25%

IQE = Q3 - Q1

Outlier: < Q1 - 1.5IQR
		 > Q3 + 1.5IQR
		 
		 
## standardizing 
		 
for normal distribution: 68% data fall within 1 SD of mean
95% of data fall within 2 SD of mean.


Bessel's correction: Since the sample tend be drawn from the majority of population
(for example the middle part of normal distribution ), so we use n-1 to estimate sigma instead of n


## Normal Distribution 


## Sampling distribution 

central limit theorem: N(x(bar), sigma / n = SE)
