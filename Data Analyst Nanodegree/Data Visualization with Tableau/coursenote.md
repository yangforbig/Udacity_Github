Lesson 1 Data Visualization Fundamentals
 
1. For quantitative data, especially when comparing two variables, dots are preferred.

2. Since humans see trends from lines, it's inappropriate to use lines when a trend doesnâ€™t make sense.

3.  Color is often used to encode a third dimension since it is really difficult 
	to interpret three dimensional data on a two dimensional plane

5.  Choropleths use color to encode another value associated with the location on the map 
such as population, population density, GDP, etc. 
Cartograms are similar to choropleths, but distort the boundaries of regions - 
such as countries - to encode a value, typically along with some color encoding
